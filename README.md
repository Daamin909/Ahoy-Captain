Ahoy Captain is a fun and mischievous Discord bot that lets you troll innocent people in your server by mimicking their messages in pirate speak and throwing playful insults their way. 🌊💀🚢

## Features 🛥️🌍🏴

- **Target Specific Users**: Choose which users to troll.
- **Message Replacement**: Replaces the targeted user's message with a new one in pirate speak, using their exact name and profile picture for authenticity.
- **Playful Insults**: Tags the user after replacing their message and insults them in pirate speak.
- **Ultimate Prank Tool**: Make your friends question reality while keeping the pirate theme alive.

## How It Works 🚢⚓🌊

1. The bot intercepts messages in the server.
2. If the sender is a targeted user, the bot deletes their message.
3. A replacement message is sent in pirate speak, crafted to seem like the original user sent it.
4. The bot then tags the user and adds a pirate-themed insult.

"Turn your Discord server into the high seas of chaos!" 🏴⚓💀
